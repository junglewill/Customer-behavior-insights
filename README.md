# Customer Behavior Insights 

This project was to handle datasets collected from an online clothing store to find insights and give out marketing suggestion. 

The datasets we used include membership data, order data and data on customers’ online behavior over time. The programming language is Python. We used Excel and Tableau to facilitate some parts of the analysis. 

The project description was as below:

- #### Objective  
Analyze the customer online behavior of a specific group of customers (by our definition) through statistics and modeling to solve the pain points and suggest marketing strategies. 

- #### Problem Statement  
What ordering methods and online activities do New customers most frequently utilize and perform when they convert into Active customers (labeled as N-A)?

- #### Methodology  
  - Categorize the customers as New, Active, Potential and Losing members (NAPL model) to analyze customer loyalty
  - Re-arrange the customers’ behavioral data and their orders by customer ID and label the customer migration patterns to differentiate each customer's behavior over time (For example, a customer could shift from a New member to an Active member, etc.)
  - Conduct descriptive statistics analysis to portray basic features of customers' behavior and RFM model to evaluate customer lifetime value, using the membership data and order data.
  - Extract the activities 90 days before the customer turned from a New member to an Active member from the customers' behavioral dataset.
  - Clean up the data and prepare for modeling
  - Build up models  
    1. Logistic Regression Model (compared to the behavior of L-A and P-A customer group)
    2. Decision Tree Model
  - Conclude and develope strategies

It was a group project created in the Big Data and Business Analytics course at National Taiwan University. I grouped the customers using NAPL model and the migratrion patterns with the assistance of Tableau and extracted customer activities using Python, while my teammates covered the modeling at that time.
